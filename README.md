ProxyTool
=========

ProxyTool can be used to get web pages anonymously with the urllib2 library in Python. The way it works is it randomly
selects a proxy from a list of proxy and then accesses the page through that proxy.

This code can be used with MapReduce for distributed data scrapping. I created a simple example using <a href="https://github.com/michaelfairley/mincemeatpy">Michael Fairley's Mincemeat.py</a>.
